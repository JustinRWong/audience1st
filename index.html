          <p>Audience1st is an  open-source, all-in-one system for ticketing, subscriptions, development, and backoffice functions, designed expressly for the needs, budgets and constraints of small to medium community theaters.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/armandofox/audience1st/wiki/">overview</a>
may help you decide if Audience1st is right for your venue.  It includes
  links to a detailed user's guide.</p>

<p>Audience1st is open source, and you can use it royalty-free under the
  Simplified BSD License.  You can either have your IT staff deploy it, or <a href="https://github.com/armandofox/audience1st/wiki/Hosting-quote-request">pay me</a> to host it for you.</p>

<a id="more-than-a-ticketing-system" class="anchor" href="#more-than-a-ticketing-system" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>More than a ticketing system</h3>

<p>By linking your own ticket sales, discount ticket sales (such as Goldstar), donation information, and other patron behaviors together, and letting you export customer reports not only to spreadsheets but directly to email-marketing services like MailChimp, Audience1st helps you build the "community" around your community theater&mdash;turning discount buyers into full-price buyers, then into repeat buyers, then into subscribers, and ultimately into donors and supporters.  Low-cost third-party ticketing solutions that stop at ticket sales can't help you do this.</p>

<p>Audience1st was developed specifically for the needs of nonprofit community performing-arts organizations, with extensive functions for donor tracking and email campaigns integrated with ticket sales and box office operations, integration with social networking such as Facebook, streamlined user interfaces that are easy for your volunteers to learn (the box office agent’s user interface closely follows the patron user interface, so your patrons can easily become volunteer box office agents), and a high degree of automation around ticket sales, phone-based information and sales, reporting/bookkeeping, and box office management, to minimize human resources needed on your end.</p>
