  %h2 Test Sending Transactional Emails
  %p
    By sending a test email, you can verify that email sending for confirmations,
    purchases, and so on is working correctly, and that your HTML email template looks
    the way you want.
    
  = form_tag email_test_options_path do
    .form-row
      .col-md-2.text-right
        %label.col-form-label Send a test email to: 
      .col-md-3
        = email_field_tag 'email', '', :class => 'form-control', :placeholder => 'you@example.com'
      .col-md-1= submit_tag 'Send', :class => 'btn btn-success'

#test_swipe
  %h2 Test Your Card Swipe

  %p 
    Plug in your card reader and scan a card.  No card information will be
    sent anywhere, but the card data will be displayed below so you
    can check if the reader is working correctly.

  %p
    Note that the CVV code is <strong>not</strong> encoded on the magnetic stripe,
    so even with a properly functioning card reader, that code must always be
    entered manually.
