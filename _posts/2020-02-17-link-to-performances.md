When you're ready to start selling tickets for a production, you will
probably want a way to provide a "Buy Tickets" link from your
theater's home page directly to Audience1st's Buy Tickets page.

There are five ways to do this.

## Link to "Buy Tickets" for a particular production

This method yields a link that lands on the "Buy Tickets" page with
a particular production pre-selected.  The patron must still select a
performance date.

1. Login to Audience1st as box office staff or higher.  

2. Click the **Season** tab.

3. Click the link icon ![link](../assets/link.png) next to the name of a production.

4. A pop-up box will appear with a link that you can copy and paste
onto your theater's website. 

## Link to "Buy Tickets" for a specific performance date

This method creates a link that lands on the "Buy Tickets" page with a
_specific performance date_ preselected (although the patron is free
to select a different performance).

1. Login to Audience1st as box office staff or higher.  

2. Click the **Season** tab.

3. Click the name of the production for which you want to link to a
performance.

4. Under the **Performances** section of the page, click the link icon
![link](../assets/link.png) next to a performance date and time.

4. A pop-up box will appear with a link that you can copy and paste
onto your theater's website. 

## Display a list of upcoming performances with links to buy tickets

If your theater's website is built with WordPress, you can 
use WordPress's built-in RSS widget to display a list of upcoming
performances along with a link to buy tickets for each.

explains how.

## Display a list of upcoming performances with approximate ticket availability

If your theater's website is built with WordPress, you can  download
and install the
[Audience1st Ticket Availability Widget]({% post_url

thermometers" for each performance.

## Display a calendar of upcoming performances

If your theater's website is built with WordPress, you can  display a
calendar of upcoming performances with links to buy tickets, by
installing and configuring the [Wordpress iCal plug-in]({% post_url
