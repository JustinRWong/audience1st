To speed up taking credit cards at front-of-house (whether for
ticket/subscription purchases, donations, or [retail purchases]()), you
can purchase a [credit card reader](http://amzn.to/2uPWyMk) that plugs
into a USB port.

On any Audience1st screen where credit card info can be entered, you can
either type the info manually or swipe a card.  **NOTE:** For security
reasons, the 3 digit "CVV code" on the back of the card (for AmEx, 4
digits on front of card) is **not** recorded on the credit card's
magnetic stripe, so that information **always** must be typed in
manually.

# Testing your swipe reader

You can test your swipe reader by clicking the Options tab (you must be
a Box Office Manager level or above to see that tab) to reveal the
[site-wide options screen](sitewide-options.html).  Scroll all the
way to the bottom and you'll find a button that takes you to a screen
where you can test-swipe credit cards without having the data sent
anywhere.
