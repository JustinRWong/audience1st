If your theater's web site is based on
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org), you can use the following plug-ins to
integrate it with Audience1st.

## Ticket Availability for Upcoming Shows

[Ticket
Availability](https://wordpress.org/plugins/audience1st-ticket-availability)
shows a thermometer-like view of ticket availability for upcoming
performances (you select how many, and set some other options, by
logging in to your WordPress administration console and selecting the
Audience1st Ticket Availability submenu under Settings in the left-hand
navbar). 

The default styling of the thermometers resembles the following image,
but you can modify the `style.css` file included with the plugin to
change it.  The thresholds for Excellent, Good, etc. can be set in the
[site-wide options](../setup/sitewide-options.html).
