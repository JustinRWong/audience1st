There are five basic categories of reports, all available from the
_Reports_ tab in the navbar (you must have Staff access or higher to run
reports). 

1. Ticket Sales Reports tell you how many tickets and of what types have
been sold for a given production or performance, including sales of
subscriptions that require fulfillment by mail.

2. Accounting/Financial reports categorize your income and expenses by
production, by account code (see below), and by payment method (credit
card, check, etc.)

3. Customer Lists let you search for customers based on criteria such as
which shows they've attended, what their zip code is, whether they've
donated recently, and so on.  The results of these queries can be
downloaded as Excel spreadsheets (e.g. for printing mailing labels) or
can be sent to an Email Marketing Platform such as MailChimp or
ConstantContact.

4. Orders Needing Fulfillment generates a list of mailing-label-friendly
names and addresses for customers who have placed orders requiring mail
fulfillment.  When a voucher or other saleable item is set up, one of
the options is "Requires mail fulfillment"; any orders including such
products will show up on this list.
