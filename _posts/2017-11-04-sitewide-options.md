Audience1st has a variety of site-wide options you can set; most of them
will only be set once, but some you may find useful to change
periodically.
All can be found by clicking the Options tab on the main navbar (you
must be logged in as Box Office Manager or higher to see this tab).

Hover over the question mark icon
![questionmark](../assets/question.png) next to each setting on that
screen for more
information about what that setting controls.

**Important:** You must click the Save button at the bottom of the
screen for your changes to take effect.  They will typically take effect
within a few minutes.
