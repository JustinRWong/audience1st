To add a new show (production), click the Season tab and then "Add New
Show".  (It doesn't matter what season is currently shown when you click
"Add New Show"; a new show's season is automatically set based on its
opening and closing dates.)

Fill in the information about the new show; you can hover over the
question-mark icons for information about what each field represents.
Click "Create" when done, or "Don't Create" to cancel the operation.

Once a show has been created, it will appear in the list when you click
the Season tab.  (**Note:** Keep in mind that if it's currently 2016 and
you are adding shows with run dates in the 2017 season, in order to see
them in the list you will have to select 2017 from the "Listing shows
for season:" dropdown menu.)

Click on "[Link]" next to the name of an existing show to get a popup
window showing a link that takes the customer directly to a purchase
page pre-populated for that show.  You can copy and paste this link onto
your theater's website or into an announcement email.

You can click on an existing show's name to modify any of the
information you added.  Continue this process until all shows are added.

## Adding Show Dates (Performances) to Each Show

Click on the name of a show to see its details, including its list of
performance dates at the bottom of the page.  To add new performance
dates, click "Add a Performance" and fill in the recurring information;
for example, you might first add all the Friday and Saturday evening
performances, then click "Save & Add More Dates", then add all
the Sunday matinees.  Continue adding performances until all the
performances for this show have been added.  It doesn't matter in what
order you add them, as they'll always be listed in date order.
