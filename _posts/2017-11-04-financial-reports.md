Every dollar of earned revenue (i.e. ticket sales) and unearned revenue (i.e. donations) is credited to some Account Code.  You can think of account codes as fund numbers; for example, if you use external software such as QuickBooks to do your accounting, you can create account codes that match the numerical codes QuickBooks typically uses.

Audience1st always comes with one "default" account code for the General Fund.  You can add your own account codes and you can delete the default one, but you can never delete the only account code.  Adding and editing account codes is available from most screens where you must provide an account code in order to do something.

To run a financial report, select the desired transaction dates and the report type, and select which Account Codes you want to include in the report (control-click or command-click to select multiple).

* Transaction Details shows you a record per payment transaction, where every element of the record (order number, customer name, etc.) is clickable to go to the details of that order.

* Earned and Unearned Revenue shows you ticket, retail item, and donation income, subtotaled by payment type, production name, and account code.

When the report results are displayed, at the top of the report output
you'll see buttons to allow you to generate an Excel (CSV) spreadsheet
or a nicely-formatted PDF file of the report.
