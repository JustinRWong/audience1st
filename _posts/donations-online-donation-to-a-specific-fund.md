A URL of the form
`https://audience1st.com/`_your-venue-name_`/donate_to_fund/XXXX`, where
`XXXX` is an Account Code string, will land the patron on a "donate by
credit card" page such that the donation will be credited to the
corresponding Account Code.

If `XXXX` does not correspond to any existing Account Code, the default
Account Code for donations (see [First-Time
Setup](../first-time-setup.md)) will be used. 

If this page is viewed in Admin mode, a cash or check donation can be
recorded to the specific fund.  If viewed by a regular patron, the only
way to donate is via credit card.
