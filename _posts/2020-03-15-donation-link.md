There are two ways to set up a link from your theater's main site to
accept donations directly via Audience1st.

**NOTE:** If you've been using another service such as PayPal for
accepting credit card donations, consider switching to receiving these
donations through Audience1st instead.  This way,
donations will be properly recorded, [account-coded]({% post_url
2017-10-28-account-codes %}), and associated with the correct
customer (if they have ever bought tickets from you via Audience1st
before), and will show up automatically in financial reports from
Audience1st.

A link to `https://your-theater-name.audience1st.com/donate` takes the
patron to a "quick donate" page where they can make a credit card
donation without logging in or having an account. Donations go to the
default donation fund specified at setup time. 

A link to
`https://your-theater-name.audience1st.com/donate_to_fund/NNNN` takes
the patron to a page coded to donate to the fund whose [account
code]({% post_url 2017-10-28-account-codes %})
is NNNN, for specific fundraising campaigns. For example, if you have
a fund coded 83956 for a particular project, `https://your-theater-name.audience1st.com/donate_to_fund/83956`
will go to a page that accepts donations that will be coded to that
fund.
