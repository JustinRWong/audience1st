# Show me patrons who...

The various types of Customer Lists can be used to filter patrons who meet specific criteria, such as show attendance, activity on your site (i.e. last time they logged in or bought tickets), address info, and more.  Spend some time exploring the different report types.

All the reports have in common a "What do with the results" options.  You can estimate the number of matching customers without generating the list; display the list of matching customers on the screen; download the list of matching customers as an Excel spreadsheet; or, if you have configured Audience1st to communicate with MailChimp, you can send the resulting list to one of those services so you can use the list for a targeted email campaign.  If you use MailChimp, the list you export will appear as a new "static segment" of your MailChimp master list, with a name that you choose.  Constant Contact support is coming soon.
