When you click the **Box Office** tab, you'll see the FOH dashboard which shows you:

* The performance date and time for which you're running FOH (click **Change** to select a different performance)
* The "true capacity" of the house for this performance
* The number of advance tickets sold for this performance
* The number of walkup tickets sold for this performance (sold at the box office the day of the show)
* The number of seats still available (true capacity less advance sales less walkup sales)

Each time you check-in an advance-reservation customer or make a walkup sale, these totals are redisplayed.

From the FOH dashboard you can:

* [Sell walkup tickets](walkup-sales.html) (day of show, sold at box office), including a
walkup-sales report when the box office closes

* [Check in advance reservations](willcallresrevation-checkin.html)
(will call).  As you sell walkup tickets and check-in customers
electronically, Audience1st tells you how many will-call customers you're
still waiting on, and how many walkup seats are still available to be
sold.
