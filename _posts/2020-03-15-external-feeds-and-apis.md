Beyond the specific integrations listed in this user documentation,
developer-facing documentation for those wishing to use Audience1st
feeds and APIs can be found in the [GitHub repo's
wiki](https://github.com/armandofox/audience1st/wiki).

Please [email us](mailto:info@audience1st.com) if you would like to
contribute a plugin or integration, or have a suggestion for one, or
would like something exposed as a feed or API that isn't already.
