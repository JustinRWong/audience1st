From the [FOH Dashboard](front-of-house-dashboard.html), if you click
_Reservation Checkin_, you'll see a list of all customers with advance
tickets for this performance, in alphabetical order.  Customers
highlighted in green are Subscribers.  

As you sell walkup tickets and check-in customers
electronically, this page is updated to tell you how many will-call customers you're
still waiting on, and how many seats are still available to be
sold. 

## For General Admission performances:

To check-in all or part of a
party, click on the appropriate number next to that customer's name.
For example, if 3 people out of a party of 4 for Jason Mahoney have
arrived, click the number 3 next to Jason Mahoney's name to check in 3 people.
You can "un-check-in" an entire party by clicking the **X** next to the
customer's name.

## For Reserved Seating performances:

Click on a seat number to check in that specific seat.  For example,
if Jason Mahoney's party of 4 has seats D1, D2, D3, D4, and 3 people
have arrived, you might click on D1, D2, and D3 to check in those
specific seats.
You can "un-check-in" an entire party by clicking the **X** next to the
customer's name.

## No Internet? Prefer to check customers in manually?

If you prefer to check customers in manually, you can instead click
_Printable Door List_ from the FOH Dashboard.
Using a printable list sacrifices the
convenience of the automatic counters, but allows you to run FOH in a
box office with no Internet access.
