From the [FOH Dashboard](front-of-house-dashboard.html), if you click
_Reservation Checkin_, you'll see a list of all customers with advance
tickets for this performance, in alphabetical order.  Customers
highlighted in green are Subscribers.  To check-in all or part of a
party, click on the appropriate number next to that customer's name.
For example, if 3 people out of a party of 4 for Jason Mahoney have
arrived, click the number 3 next to Jason Mahoney's name.   

You can "un-check-in" an entire party by clicking the **X** next to the
customer's name.

If you prefer to check customers in manually, you can instead click
_Printable Door List_ from the FOH Dashboard.
Using a printable list sacrifices the
convenience of the automatic counters, but allows you to run FOH in a
box office with no Internet access.
