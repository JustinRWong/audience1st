The initial deployment of Audience1st contains a single administrative user whose login is `admin@audience1st.com` and password `admin`.  

0. **The first thing you should do is login as this user and edit the
user name and information to match whoever the box office manager or
operations manager is.**  The Admin privilege is the highest privilege
and can do anything, so set a good password.  Make sure you are able to
receive  email at the
address you give for this user, in case you need to use the "Forgot
Password" mechanism later to reset your password by email.

0. While still logged in as admin, click the Options tab in the main
navigation bar to setup [site-wide options including venue
information](sitewide-options.html).   
Some of it
is necessary before patrons can buy tickets.  (Whoever deployed the site
for you should have taken care of the necessary steps to connect
Audience1st to Stripe for payment processing and to MailChimp or
ConstantContact for sending marketing emails.)

0. Next, [create user records](../customers/looking-up-a-customer.html) for additional staff (box office, phone
orders, FOH staff, anyone who will need some level of administrative
access).  Edit each user's
Billing/Contact info, and under Admin settings for that user, set their
privilege level as appropriate (you can always change it later). 

0. To import existing customer data, click the Import tab.  (Description
TBD as this feature is under refurbishment)
