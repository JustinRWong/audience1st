To fulfill telephone sales for a patron, you must [locate or add the
patron]({% post_url 2017-10-28-looking-up-a-customer %}), and once you
are viewing their "My Tickets" screen, click the "Buy Tickets" tab.

From that point on, you can enter information on behalf of the patron
as if they were making the purchase themselves online.  The only
difference is that as a box office staff member, you can also record
the purchase as Check or Cash, whereas customer self-purchases can
only be paid by credit card.
