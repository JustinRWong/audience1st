If you just want to display a list of show dates along with
"Available" or "Sold Out" information for each, you can use the
built-in WordPress "RSS Widget" that can be embedded on any page.

1) Add an RSS widget to any WordPress page where you want to display
upcoming showdate availability.

2) In the widget's settings, set the RSS feed URL to
`http://`_your-theater_`.audience1st.com/rss/showdates.rss`

3) Set the "number of items to display" to the maximum number of
upcoming showdates and times you'd like the widget to show.
