## General Admission performances

If a subscriber shows up without having made a reservation, and seats
are available, on the [automated will-call check-in screen]({% post_url 2017-11-04-willcallreservation-checkin %})
you can start typing a customer's name into "Checkin subscriber
without reservation".  If the subscriber has any available vouchers
that are redeemable for this performance, you can choose which one(s)
to use to check them in. 


## Reserved Seating performances

To checkin a subscriber without a reservation for a
Reserved Seating performance, you must [make the reservation using the subscriber's My
Tickets page]({% post_url 2020-03-15-making-reservations %})
using an available subscriber voucher,
since seat(s) must be selected for the performance.
