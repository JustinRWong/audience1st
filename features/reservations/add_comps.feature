Feature: add comps and reserve for a show

  As a box office worker
  So I can comp my best customers
  I want to add comp tickets for a particular performance

Background: logged in as admin and shows are available

  Given I am logged in as boxoffice manager
  And 2 "Comp" comps are available for "Macbeth" on "April 20, 2010, 8pm"

Scenario Outline: add comps to performance

  Given it is currently <time>
  When I visit the add comps page for customer "Tom Foolery"
  When I select "Comp (2010)" from "What type:"
  And  I fill in "How many:" with "<number>"
  And  I select "Macbeth - Tuesday, Apr 20, 8:00 PM (2 left)" from "Reserve for:"
  And  I fill in "Optional comments:" with "Courtesy Comp"
  And I check "customer_email"
  And  I press "Add Vouchers"
  Then customer "Tom Foolery" should have an order with comment "Courtesy Comp" containing the following tickets:
  | qty      | type | showdate       |
  | <number> | Comp | Apr 20, 8:00pm |
  And an email should be sent to customer "Armando Fox"

  Examples:

  | time                 | number |
  | Apr 20, 2010, 8:15pm |      2 |
  | Apr 18, 2010         |      2 |
  | Apr 18, 2010         |      4 |
  | Apr 20, 2010, 8:15pm |      4 |
