%h1 Terms of Use and Privacy Policy

%p.lead
  Audience1st software ("A1") is used by several arts
  organizations (the "Organizations") to steward their audiences, sell
  tickets and subscriptions, and accept donations from their Patrons.
  This policy describes what information is collected and how it is used.  By
  transacting with an Organization that uses A1 (as identified by
  the phrase "Powered by Audience1st" in the footer of their
  ticket-sales and donations pages), you agree to the below
  terms, and you also agree to the Organization's own terms of service and
  privacy policy for how they use this data.

%h2.h2 Collection of personally identifiable information (PII)

%p
  Individual patrons may sometimes
  enter personal identifiable information ("PII") such as names
  and contact information as part of transacting with an Organization.
  A1 and its stewards will never access, analyze, or disclose PII
  to any other party except
  (a) as required to comply with applicable laws and (b) to assist
  the Organizations in resolving specific operational issues.
  While no information technology is one hundred percent secure, A1
  takes strong precautions to ensure that such information
  is securely transmitted and securely stored.

%p
  Each Organization has complete control over its own patron data
  and may have additional policies regarding how they use it.
  At the request of any Organization, A1 will destroy all extant
  copies of any patron data.  

%p
  Patrons wishing to have their data expunged should directly
  contact the Organization holding the data.

%h2 Communication

%p
  The only direct communication between A1 and any Patron
  consists of individual transaction-confirmation emails.  Patrons
  will never receive any other email of any kind from A1, though
  they may (depending on the policy of the Organization) receive
  other email such as marketing communications from the
  Organization.


%p
  Patrons will never receive any solicitation of any kind from A1,
  and in particular, will never be asked for their login
  information or any other PII.


%h2 Credit Card Information

%p.strong
  No information about your credit card number or account ever
  passes through or is collected by A1's computers, nor made available to any
  Organization.

%p
  All credit card transactions are handled directly by
  %a{:href=>"https://stripe.com"} Stripe,
  which has sole access to
  your credit card information.  Please consult Stripe's
  %a{:href =>"https://stripe.com/privacy-center"} privacy center
  for information on how they may use that information.

%h2 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

%p
  In the language of GDPR, A1 is a data processor, not a data
  controller.  We process Patrons' PII as needed to fulfill the
  functions used by the Organizations using A1.  The Organizations
  are GDPR data controllers.  EU citizens wishing to exercise
  specific rights under the GDPR should communicate directly with
  the Organization that collected the data.

%h2 Cookies

%p
  A1's correct operation relies on cookies--small data files that
  we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes,
  such as to keep you logged in, differentiate you from other Patrons,
  enable certain navigation features of A1, and monitor the site for
  correct operation.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its
  options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a
  cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, you
  will be unable to complete most transactions using A1.

%h2 Third Parties

%p
  A1 makes use of third party services to facilitate its
  operations, including maintenance services, database management, and
  web analytics.  To the extent that any third party has access to PII,
  they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose
  than ensuring correct operation of the specific service(s) they
  provide to A1.


%h2 Children Under 13

%p
  In accordance with COPPA,
  %span.strong patrons under 13 years of age should not use A1 at any time or in any manner.
  A1 does not knowingly collect or maintain PII about such
  Patrons, and if A1's stewards learn that such information has been
  collected, we will take the appropriate steps to delete it.
  If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who
  uses A1, please
  contact the Organization through whom the information was
  collected to have that childâ€™s information deleted, as A1 does
  not use or analyze Organizations' information about Patrons
  except as above.


%h2 Contact/Further Information

%p
  Please email 
  %a{:href=>"mailto:privacy@audience1st.com"} privacy@audience1st.com
  with any further questions about the above policies.
